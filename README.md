# cpp_templates
Just some handy template files for my projects

# Why?
Just makes life a little easier, you know? You can just pull this to a folder and start cracking at it.

# How?
Run `git clone https://github.com/jadonwolffs/cpp_templates.git folder_name` - where `folder_name` is the folder you want to create it in
Then manually delete the `.git` folder in there or change into the directory and run `rm -fr .git*`

# Who?
That'd be me [jadon](https://www.github.com/jadonwolffs)

# TODO
[ ] separate branches for different configurations
[ ] make script to handle the cloning and set up of a new templated project which can count as the binaries for this repo
[ ] set up GitHub pages for this repo
  [ ] link this repo and its page to my main project page
